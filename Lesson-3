Lesson 3 - In this lab I would like you to do the following. 

1. Create a directory structure /tmp/files/pictures, /tmp/files/photos and /tmp/files/videos
2. Copy all files that have aname starting with an a, b, or c from /etc to /tmp/files
3. From /tmp/files, move all files that have a name starting with an a or b to /tmo/files/photos, and filew with a name starting with a c to /tmp/files/videos
4. Find all files in /etc that have a size smaller than 1000 bytes and copy those to /tmp/files/pictures
5. In /tmp/files, create a symbolic link to /var
6. Create a compressed archive file of the /home direcoty
7. Extract this compressed archive file with relative file names in /tmp/archive
